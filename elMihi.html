                <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeInfoboy"><h3 align="center">by elMihi</h3></a>

                    SOL price stability is key for REAL short term profits<br>
                    The key to real (not paper) short term profits in NFTs is a somewhat stable token price, in this case SOL.<br>
                    When I say paper I'm referring to a false sense of profits, as is happening now where project FP's are pumping but the real $ profits are negative.<br>
                    So how do we get the REAL profits ? We look for some/any kind of stability for at least a couple of weeks before we jump back in.<br>
                    I expect the coming months to have a couple more dumps in Crypto prices so I will share with you my USDC-SOL conversion setup later on (saved me in the last dump).<br>
                    <br>
                    What can push SOL lower ?<br>
                    I see 3 main factors still in play:<br>
                    - FTX/Alameda liquidation<br>
                    - Domino effect of insolvent players (4 already paused withdrawals, 2 on the brink of bankruptcy while the other 2 a asking for emergency funding) <br>
                    - Global recession (first time crypto will experience a bear during a global recession, expect bigger downside than previous cycles)<br>
                    <br>
                    Is it stable enough for trading ? <br>
                    I am personally w8ing to see if we get one more push lower before finding a temporary bottom before I start trading again. <br>
                    Its been 8 days since the local low was made around 12.5 so Id like to give it a couple more days before I convert USDC to SOL and start trading again.<br>
                    On a positive not mints have been doing better these last 2 days and the overall sentiment is picking back up.<br>
                    <br>
                    Example on why stability matters<br>
                    A visual representation of the "paper" profits which in reality are $ losses. <br>
                    Paper profit +45%<br>
                    $ profit -6%<br>

                <p align="center">
                    Stoned Ape Crew is a project with a 4200 supply that came out in late November 21'<br> and had a mint price of 0.69 SOL (SOL was 200$).<br>
                    <br>

                    What Is Stoned Ape Crew<br>
                    Stoned Ape Crew is a utility/community based project.<br>
                    The main driver behind the project is the OG community.<br>
                    <br>
                    Utility<br>
                    This is one of the bigger OG projects (1 year anniversary is in 2 weeks) so a lot has happened since they first minted, I'll try to keep it as short as possible.<br>
                    The native token is called $PUFF (0.01$) and can be earned via staking.<br> 
                    Staking is a bit all over the place in regards to emissions and halvings so I'll give you the vanilla numbers.<br>
                    Chimpions: earn 10.2 $PUFF daily. Awakened: 20.4 $PUFF. Shockwaved: 40.8 $PUFF.<br>
                    These are the initial numbers, they do NOT include 2 halvings of 32% and 42%.<br>
                    There were 2 types of "upgrades": Retreats (V1) and the Awakening (V2).<br>
                    Retreats (V1) - use $PUFF to get  a new role and earn more via staking, depending on the amount of $PUFF<br> you burned you hade a higher or lower chance of getting the role (1420 $PUFF was the 100% limit)<br>
                    Awakening (V2) - same concept use $PUFF to unlock 2 versions, an animated & a static one tied to the same NFT.<br>
                    ALL BLUE - was the projects play on being and incubator and a launchpad but it failed and the team has discontinued the utility.<br>
                    The main area the team is looking to expand now is the payments sector with their PayLeaf.<br>
                    PayLeaf enables customers to pay with their mobile phone at any retail location that accepts PayLeaf in a peer2peer way.<br>
                    <br>
                    Overview<br>
                    Honestly there is so much more to talk about like Nuked apes, Magic J's, CBD's, etc... but its hard to fill 1 year of events in a short text.<br>
                    I want to add just one more thing, SAC was considered one of the best bluechips back in Q1 of 22 but the main "downfall" was the token.<br>
                    The ATH in price was 0.8$ and while the project kept coming out with new utilities and features the token inevitably saw a big decline and is now worth 0.01$.<br>
                    Just goes to show that the token price of a project can make or break a project, sadly due to whale games and p&d it usually turns out bad.<br> 
                    The team has never stopped building and adding value but the huge drop in the token price was just too much.<br>
                    <br>
                    Stats<br>

                <h2 align="center">Why are NFT floors "pumping" right now ? 11/15/2022</h2>
                <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeInfoboy"><h3 align="center">by elMihi</h3></a>
                <br>
                <p align="center">
                    And no the answer is not the bull run is back<br> 
                    We went over the concept behind the $ value of NFTs yesterday, which is the main reason behind this "pump" (re-calibration) in price.<br> 
                    SOL/USDC has dumped 70% in the past week so the underlining $ value of NFTs is down bad, the current "pump" is only trying to re-establish old $ values.<br> 
                    In simpler terms more SOL is required to reach old $ value floors.<br> 
                    <br> 
                    Examples<br> 
                    y00ts = pervious floor 70 SOL (sol 30$) - new floor 101 SOL (sol 14$) = net difference negative 700$<br> 
                    ABC = pervious floor 22 SOL (sol 30$) - new floor 29 SOL (sol 14$) = net difference negative 250$<br> 
                    OK bears = pervious floor 35 SOL (sol 30$) - new floor 46 SOL (sol 14$) = net difference negative 400$<br> 
                    <br> 
                    Even though it looks like all fp's are pumping and new highs/profits are being made in reality we are still down bad in $ terms.<br> 
                    In the following days I will write a post about the main things I'm looking for before I go back to actively trading.<br>

                    <br>
                    What Is Meta Tattoo Club<br>
                    Meta Tattoo Club is an IRL based project.<br>

                    <br>
                    Utility<br>
                    The native token is called $INK (no LP atm) and can be earned by staking.<br>
                    Staking has two forms: Shop staking and Drink the Ink.<br>
                    Shop staking is a normal version of vanilla staking while Drink the Ink is a gamefied version where you can lvl up your MTC and earn more $INK.<br>
                    $INK can/will be used in a couple of ways like:<br>
                    - IRL tattoos - use $INK to pay for IRL tattoos <br>
                    - Virtual tattoos - use $INK to get your avatar tattooed, first tattoo shop in the Sandbox<br>
                    - Ink vial - use $INK to purchase an Ink Vial, lvl up your Ink Vial to lvl 5 in order to upgrade your NFT and earn more $INK daily while staking.<br>
                    - Merch and giveaways<br>
                    <br>
